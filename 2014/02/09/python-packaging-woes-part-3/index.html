<p>A bit of wrap-up.</p>

<h3>Current state of the things</h3>

<p>I seem to have missed something: there&rsquo;s now a very active <a href="https://github.com/pypa">Python</a> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa">Packaging</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypa-dev">Authority</a> which is trying very hard to push Python packaging in the right direction, so that we can have a good set of tools that work properly together. Checkout their repositories and mailing lists.</p>

<p>Setuptools and distribute got <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2013-March/020126.html">merged</a> and we won&rsquo;t experience a split-experience anymore, we&rsquo;ll just have One Tool To Rule Them All!</p>

<p>So, rejoice! Things are getting better!</p>

<h3>In the meantime</h3>

<p>I recommend using <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org">Pip</a> . Always try using requirements.txt, it&rsquo;s a good way to keep your versions
consistent and working.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org">virtualenv</a> for development purposes, and <strong>always test your package in a virtualenv with a disabled site-packages</strong>! Otherwise you risk you&rsquo;re distributing something that works on your workstation only because of a site-wide package you have installed there!</p>

<p>In order to distribute a package, you&rsquo;ll need setuptools/distribute as well;
just do a source distribution and a wheel distribution (you&rsquo;re required to
install <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel">wheel</a> beside setuptools); forget
about eggs, especially for eggs containing binary extensions.  Your command line
should be something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>python setup.py clean register sdist bdist_wheel upload</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And let&rsquo;s keep our fingers crossed on a better state of things!</p>
