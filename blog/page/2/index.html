  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s a practice of good programming which is often referred as <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=35578">One Assertion Per Test</a>.
In the opinion of some people, this practice would advocate the usage of a single call to xunit assert method for each test.</p>

<p>I think that idea is plainly wrong. Saying &ldquo;One Test Per Test&rdquo; would have been better, but implied an high <a href="http://xkcd.com/703/">tautology risk</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take an old-and-trite shopping cart example; we have a cart which the user fills, then a checkout happens and we have a completed order, which holds things like a total amount for the order and a list of items.</p>

<p>Sometimes people will complain about this (Python is used throughout the examples, yet the concept applies to any language):</p>

<p>Do you see? One assertion per test.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/download.jpeg"></p>

<p>Frankly speaking, that&rsquo;s bullshit. One assertion per test does <strong>not</strong> mean that. One assertion per test means <strong>test ONE THING for each of your tests</strong>.
You should begin thinking about whether your object does too many things and whether your test methods are properly named.</p>

<p>A possible example would be:</p>

<p>Here, since the checkout process is doing multiple things (and it probably should as it is a checkout &ndash; this is probably more an example of an acceptance test rather than a unit test), we test them separately. If either fails, we know why and can go straight to the issue &ndash; and yet consider rewriting the second test like that:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_successful_checkout_order_items_are_items_from_the_cart</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEquals</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">item1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">completed_order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEquals</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">item2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">completed_order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If the example above is good, that&rsquo;s good as well, and you may have reasons for doing things like that &ndash; maybe your test framework doesn&rsquo;t show you the differences in a very clear way and you want to be sure to quickly catch the wrong item. This is what <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Robert C. Martin</a> calls <em>Single Concept per Test</em> in his own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> book &ndash; a recommended reading!</p>

<p>So, <em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re testing multiple things in a single test&rdquo;</em> can be a good remark. <em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using multiple assertions per test&rdquo;</em>, on the contrary, means nothing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a spinoff from my <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/talks/language-alone-wont-pay-your-bills">Europython 2012 talk</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNYO4zUDAQ">video</a>, <a href="https://ep2013.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/language-alone-wont-pay-your-bills.pdf">slides</a>).</p>

<p>Some days ago I got involved in a brief <a href="https://twitter.com/hpk42/status/292599238095933440">discussion</a> on the topic, <strong>so here&rsquo;s what I think about Python packaging and dependency management: it&rsquo;s in a very bad state, requires a lot of manual intervention to work properly and heavily limits code reuse.</strong></p>

<p>Why? Let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<h2>The Packaging Conspiracy</h2>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy to force you to learn something you don&rsquo;t care about. The whole point of packaging is to make code reuse easy enough, both for the developer&rsquo;s own sake (e.g. shared code between different projects) and for sharing it with the public.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging usually involves dependency management</strong>; this happens in most Linux distributions as well as other packaging systems (e.g. Apache Maven, Rubygems), because you don&rsquo;t just release your code in &ldquo;in the dark&rdquo;: you are releasing version 1.0.0 of your code on January, 1st 2013, and that usually matches (or should match) an exact revision on your source control system, and a precise set of dependencies, because your own software or library may have its own requirements.</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s an overkill!</h3>

<p>Some developers think all of this is a waste of their time.</p>

<p><em>D: Hey Alan, are you really saying say I can&rsquo;t just copy and paste some source code in some directory and just go on? How much time should I spend at this tedious task?!?</em></p>

<p>A: Sure, just copy and paste. And remember copying and pasting all transitive dependencies as well. And since this is Python, start hoping all your transitive dependencies are pure Python, otherwise good luck at copypasting C source code into your repo and remembering to compile it every time. And whenever you need a bugfix in your upstream dependency, good luck at remembering where you&rsquo;ve fetched that code from, and at which revision. Oh, did you write the URL and the revision somewhere in the VCS commit message? Fine, <strong>you&rsquo;re doing by hand the work that a good dependency management tool is supposed to do</strong>. If you like that.</p>

<p><em>D: OK, ok. I got it. So now I&rsquo;ve added my dependencies. But what the heck, does the version really matter? I don&rsquo;t care! If a new version of something I rely on is released, it will contain bugfixes and maybe new features, but won&rsquo;t break my code.</em></p>

<p>A: Dear developer, I think your great trust in the Developer From The Next Door is something that feeds your heart but hinders your brain. You should depend on Only One Version for your production code; when it&rsquo;s time to upgrade to a later one, you need to do a manual test run and verify everything is fine. If you forget about doing that, your imagination will be the only limit to whatever mess can happen.</p>

<p><em>D: OK, ok, now I&rsquo;ve set versions for all my deps. What version should I use for my own software, though? Can I just pick any version I like? First version 1.0, then 1.1, until I get to 1.99 and i move to 2.0?</em></p>

<p>A: Try doing something meaningful, and stick to your plan. <strong>You can pick your own versioning policy</strong>. Usually your version numbers should distinguish at least between major releases, where you can break backwards compatibility (if you must, not just because you enjoy) and add a lot of new things, and bugfix releases, where you try to minimize the changes to what really needs to be fixed, in order not to mess up client code. Many softwares used to use a two-dotted version number, something like MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION, with REVISION being used for bugfixes only, but the distinction between MAJOR and MINOR is blurred and often just something &ldquo;emotional&rdquo;. If you perform small incremental changes on your codebase &ndash; <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html">a-la-Chrome</a> &ndash; you can stick with just MAJOR.REVISION. Every feature-adding release increases the MAJOR, every bugfix increases the REVISION. Of course, remember that your MAJOR should be strictly increasing, while REVISION is usually reset at 0 for every MAJOR and then strictly increasing.</p>

<p><em>D: So, what should I do now? Where do I release my code? Should I copypaste my code somewhere? I know of a great pastebin!</em></p>

<p>A: You should usually aggregate your build into an artifact (= product of the build) and you should upload it to a shared repository, where you and other people agree uploading your software to and fetching other people software from.</p>

<p><em>D: YEAH! I&rsquo;ve just released version 0.0.2 to the public. Now I&rsquo;m deleting 0.0.1, right?</em></p>

<p>A: No. Never. Ideally, unless you must &ndash; by must I mean something like &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a password for my bank account in the source code&rdquo; or &ldquo;I mistakenly copypasted code for which I hadn&rsquo;t the copyright&rdquo; &ndash; <strong>you should never, ever, ever, remove a released version</strong>. You never know who&rsquo;s using it &ndash; if my software works fine with 0.0.1, why should I be forced to upgrade? You can shout at me if I ever ask anything about it to you, according to your version policy, but you shouldn&rsquo;t care about old versions otherwise. If tagging is supported on the repository you might want to tag old versions as &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo;, &ldquo;bugged&rdquo;, or maybe &ldquo;donut&rdquo; if they contain a huge security hole.</p>

<p><em>D: I like fancy names. Can I name my next release 2.0.5sarah? You know, it&rsquo;s my first daughter and she was born in the very day of such release.</em></p>

<p>A: I&rsquo;m happy of hearing that, but please stick with numbers only. Is 2.0.5sarah higher or lower than 2.0.6? No, &ldquo;lexicographical&rdquo; is not what you and I want to hear in such context. You may want to use a suffix/prefix/tag to mark non-final releases, e.g. alpha/beta/development releases, preferably a SINGLE suffix, which is widely recognized, for all of those, and decide once-for-all if it means lower or higher. Usually it means &ldquo;lower&rdquo;, so that 2.0.0beta is &lt; 2.0.0, but that&rsquo;s not always the case &ndash; a very good idea is to deny that the same version of a package can exist both for a development and production version. I.e. if 2.1.&lsquo;&rsquo; is beta, 2.0.5 can be a production release, but not 2.1.0 or 2.1.1.</p>

<p><em>D: There&rsquo;re a lot of things to remember about dependency management and packaging. Should I learn everything by heart?</em></p>

<p>A: What the heck, no. <strong>Your packaging tool should guide you in such practices</strong> and prevent you from going stray unless it&rsquo;s what you really mean to do! That why I&rsquo;m complaining in the first place about the way Python does packaging!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t like php, and I&rsquo;ve got <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">my reasons</a>.
I&rsquo;ve met a lot of people who dislike PHP and don&rsquo;t see how possibly anyone, anyhow, could think about ever
using PHP in any real-world project out there, and simply dismiss PHP as a crap being created and used from
and for incompetent stupid people around the world.</p>

<p>On the other side there&rsquo;re a bunch of PHP supporters which show you how wonderful is PHP, how many people
use it and how widespread it is, and whoever says the contrary is just an enterprisey fool which spends
nights at getting things done in Java or C#.</p>

<p>I disagree with both groups (of course!) and I think that PHP&rsquo;s got its unique set of killer features
that make it still valuable, and those should be acknowledged.</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s not PHP by itself &ndash; there&rsquo;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle%29">LAMP stack</a>,
a de-facto pseudo-standard; interoperability of PHP applications on many different hostings work quite well.
This is very different from most other platforms, where you must either adapt your development environment
to what your hosting provides, like in Google App Engine, or you must find a way to tune your hosting environment
to match your required dependencies. Not even Java, which heavily relies on standardized APIs, was able to
reach a similar consensus on a standard stack.</p>

<p>And this sort of Platform-as-a-Service offering is widespread. This is catching on lately for other languages
with things like <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>,
<a href="http://www.jelastic.com">Jelastic</a>, <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">Engineyard</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>
(while this last one is slightly more complex), but on PHP there&rsquo;s simply a incredible amount of really
cheap and simple hosting. If you&rsquo;re willing to spend something like 50 EUR an year you can find out really
good PHP hostings just everywhere, and you can expect to go down to 15 EUR per year and still have something
that&rsquo;s pretty decent.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s all this hosting good for? Do you create your own custom software in PHP and run on top of that? Of course
not! Many experienced PHP developers go with their own infrastracture in order to have full control and tuning;
the real bulk of PHP installations (IMHO &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have collected actual data on such topic, maybe one day I will)
consists of existing free software installations. Existing software written in PHP makes the difference.
There&rsquo;re a lot of people that simply don&rsquo;t care about PHP or programming at all, and yet they use PHP every day thanks to existing open source software.</p>

<p>Do you want a blog engine that you can customize and offers a variety of plugins that have nothing to do with
a blog? Here&rsquo;s Wordpress. Would you like to manage a community? Drupal is your friend.</p>

<p>Please note that, more often than not, the available PHP software is not the &ldquo;best of the breed&rdquo;. Other software
exists that is better, or faster, or offers more functionality, but PHP is usually &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, allows &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo;
customization, and it&rsquo;s free.</p>

<p>And doesn&rsquo;t require to be a developer to be installed &ndash; it&rsquo;s targeted at the slightly experienced user. I think
that installation wizards in PHP are really well constructed (although they often require full manual intervention
and it would be hard to automate them via command-line scripts or similar) and I sometimes miss them in other
languages (like Ruby, Python, Java), where heavy command-line and config editing is required, many times in
non-obvious way. Most PHP applications contain the application AND a web-based configuration tool for such application
&ndash; that&rsquo;s an obvious thumbs up.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;install your own web software&rdquo; approach is getting less useful nowadays, with a lot of great services around that let you
do almost anything you&rsquo;d do with a php software, yet it was very common until mid 2000s to setup your own hosting
and your own software instance, and it retains a lot of charm on users that want
to feel empowered, that want to &ldquo;own&rdquo; their website and make modifications to it (and maybe they want to say they&rsquo;re PHP
programmers because what they did) &ndash; php can be edited and new pages appear live on the server!</p>

<p>Then, don&rsquo;t forget there&rsquo;re many PHP developers around the world. It&rsquo;s not an exotic language &ndash; it&rsquo;s quite mainstream,
if you need a custom feature you won&rsquo;t go in mancraft-starvation mode. Developer quality in such world may be a problem,
but if you can find somebody who&rsquo;s not a PHP-only developer, you should feel safe.</p>

<p>And remember: most software for PHP is content-centered. There&rsquo;s very little business logic in it. PHP works
well as long as your application only does only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD">CRUD</a>. Advanced usages,
anything that would require a sort of application server or persistent, long-running process, should be avoided.</p>

<p>So, PHP is simply great for its target. If you want to have your own website, with your own domain, where you can do
whatever you like, you don&rsquo;t care for quality, uptime, or security, PHP is simply the right tool for you.</p>

<p>You can even use it for learning some programming basics, but PHP is gotcha-intensive, and you aren&rsquo;t a
real PHP programmer if you don&rsquo;t know at least 75% of <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">such gotchas</a> :&ndash;). Good luck!</p>
