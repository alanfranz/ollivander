<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;m not an hardcore Apple user. My first Apple product ever was a Macbook Pro I bought about one year ago.<br /><br />But I fell in love with the Mac platform, and I think its really strong point is that it&#8217;s <b>versatile</b>. It&#8217;s got plenty of useful proprietary apps that sometimes I want to use or I am forced to use, like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop, a pretty decent Adobe Flash implementation, but since it&#8217;s a BSD derivative it&#8217;s got a lot of nifty tools I&#8217;m used to and that I really like.<br /><br />Sure, Windows might be faster at many tasks, especially if you&#8217;re gonna spend as much money as you need to invest in Apple hardware, but my feelings towards Windows are mixed. I liked XP at the beginning, but it grew old and tired; Vista was a mess; Seven seems fine, but Microsoft still needs to conquer back my trust. Also, Windows is fine as a development platform as long as you use Microsoft tools - which are quite good - but it can get squeaky as soon as you adventure into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">FLOSS</a> land - I can remember some madness I incurred in while trying to use git under Windows.<br /><br />What about Linux? I&#8217;s a great development environment. I simply love my <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> box, it&#8217;s exactly as I want it. Eclipse, Netbeans, everything is set up as I want, all the key bindings, all the details. But my Ubuntu box is a tower form factor workstation with ethernet connectivity and two monitors - I think Ubuntu fails pretty hard at the common desktop experience, especially on a notebook - wireless connectivity is often an issue, suspend and hibernate are unreliable, the battery doesn&#8217;t last as long as I&#8217;d like, and Flash on full screen is flaky.&nbsp;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s Canonical&#8217;s own fault - it&#8217;s really hard to have an OS work on each and every hardware and giving it away from free - but from the user&#8217;s point of view this is a failure. &nbsp;Some key apps are also missing - <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>&nbsp;might not be enough a replacement for Office, and <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>&nbsp;is not quite as effective as Adobe Photoshop.<br /><br />But the Mac has it all, and that means it&#8217;s got a <b>lot</b>&nbsp;of appeal on developers - we usually want the eye candy and the dark console, we like our computer to &#8216;just work&#8217; and yet we like to be able to tune every detail. Whenever I go to a conference I can see there&#8217;re far more Macs, iPads, iPhones than in any other typical business environment. A <b>lot</b> of developers from many communities simply love using Macs for their development work -<b> I simply don&#8217;t think that developers don&#8217;t count in Mac market as someone stated. </b>Maybe many of them are not Java developers, but as soon as they&#8217;re unable to install Eclipse they&#8217;ll complain as well.<br /><br />Apple&#8217;s Java sports its own Cocoa bindings, which are very useful to achieve a native look-and-feel, OS integration and general responsiveness for all java based software. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is java based and it&#8217;s a widely used platform, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> is one of the great favourites for Ruby coders, <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a> is evolving at a great pace and supports Java, Ruby, Python, PHP and many others. Not to mention the fact that while I write those lines it&#8217;s the <b>only</b>&nbsp;JDK available and working out of the box on Snow Leopard.<br /><br />Now this is going to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010380-CH4-SW1">change</a>. Java is deprecated on Snow Leopard, won&#8217;t be included in Lion and can&#8217;t be used for Mac App Store.<br /><br />If Mac OS X were to be left with a third-party Java implementation - and let&#8217;s hope <a href="http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/">SoyLatte</a> can cope with such burden - we&#8217;ll probably lose native OS integration, everything that&#8217;s Swing or SWT based will need X11 to run, Swing will probably use its native Metal widget set while SWT will probably rely on GTK+ bindings; Apple doesn&#8217;t even seem to be willing to contribute its own patches to the OpenJDK project, even though it would be meaningful if they just didn&#8217;t want to waste resources on what they think it&#8217;s a dead technology.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not a great scenario, but the real question here is: <b>why?</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Why should Apple have done all that? Is it that difficult to <b>update&nbsp;</b>the current JDK to work with &nbsp;Lion? JDK7 might be a different topic, but hey - they&#8217;re basically dropping what they&#8217;ve already done! And they&#8217;re <b>not</b>&nbsp;letting anyone to continue their job easily.&nbsp;I think Apple is perfectly aware that the Mac OS X ecosystem is fairly different from the walled garden of IOS - &nbsp;Windows is still got a much larger market, and limiting what Mac OS X can do will just feed Microsoft&#8217;s pockets again.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think there will be an official statement on that, but I bet Oracle has a part on this. Mac JDK seems to have been built by Apple but to have sprung from Sun&#8217;s own JDK - is Oracle not willing to let this deal to go on? Maybe Apple needed to renegotiate its license and it turned out to be too expensive?&nbsp;Even though Apple may think Java is dead, it has no apparent reason to silently stab it again.<br /><br />Their decision is causing a lot of <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/Java-dev/2010/Oct/index.html">noise</a>&nbsp;in the Mac/Java community, let&#8217;s see if Steve comments on this as well.</div>
